# Transfer Connect

## 🚀 Transfer Connect makes the transfer journey smoother by linking students with mentors who’ve already navigated the path to their dream school

### 👩‍🎓 Students can:

  ✍️ Create an account
  
  🎯 Select their current school + intended area of study
  
  🔍 Search for mentors who’ve been where they are, and connect directly

### 🎓 Mentors can:

  🧑‍🏫 Sign up to share their transfer story
  
  💡 Provide guidance on everything from academics to campus life
  
  📬 Offer contact info to support students

### ⚡ Smart Matching Algorithm

Our system doesn’t just list mentors randomly. It ranks them based on how well they match a student’s profile:

  🏫 Did the mentor transfer from the same previous school? ✅
  
  📚 Are they in the same field of study? ✅
  
  🎓 Are they already at the student’s desired university? ✅
  

The better the match, the higher they appear — giving students the most relevant guidance first.

## 💬 Transfer Connect acts as a bridge between “where you are” and “where you’re going”, powered by real stories and shared experiences
