# Transfer Connect

Transfer Connect is a platform designed to help transfer students succeed by connecting them with peers who have already made the transition to their desired institution. Students can create an account, indicate their role as either a student or mentor, and use the platform to search for mentors who match their goals. Mentors, in turn, can share their own transfer experiences and provide contact information to support incoming students on their journey.
