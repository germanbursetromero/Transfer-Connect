# Transfer Peer Connect

## Transfer Peer Connect makes the transfer journey smoother by linking students with mentors who’ve already navigated the path to their dream school

### Students can:

  - Create an account
  
  - Select their current school + intended area of study
  
  - Search for mentors who’ve been where they are, and connect directly

### Mentors can:

  - Sign up to share their transfer story
  
  - Provide guidance on everything from academics to campus life
  
  - Offer contact info to support students

### Smart Matching Algorithm

Our system doesn’t just list mentors randomly. It ranks them based on how well they match a student’s profile:

  - Did the mentor transfer from the same previous school? ✅
  
  - Are they in the same field of study? ✅
  
  - Are they already at the student’s desired university? ✅
  

The better the match, the higher they appear — giving students the most relevant guidance first.

## Transfer Connect acts as a bridge between “where you are” and “where you’re going”, powered by real stories and shared experiences
